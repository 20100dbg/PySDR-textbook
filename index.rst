PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP using Python
==========================================

by :ref:`Dr. Marc Lichtman<author-chapter>` - pysdr@vt.edu

Welcome to PySDR, a free online textbook that provides a gentle introduction to wireless communications and software-defined radio (SDR) using an abundance of diagrams, animations, and Python code examples. The primary goal of PySDR is to increase accessibility to topics traditionally covered at the graduate level within a relatively small set of universities. All content of PySDR is open source, even the code used to generate the figures/animations, and can be found `here <https://github.com/777arc/PySDR>`_.

See Chapter 1: :ref:`intro-chapter` for the textbook's purpose and target audience.
